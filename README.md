# Internet Speed Finder

This repository hosts a Flask-based Internet Speed Finder application that provides a simple user interface to test download speed, upload speed, and ping. The application is responsive, has loading animations, and allows users to retry the test without refreshing the page.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Adaptable layout for various devices.
- **Test Speeds**: Measures download speed, upload speed, and ping.
- **Retry Option**: Allows users to rerun the test after results display.
- **Loading Animation**: Displays spinner and animations during the speed test.

## Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

Make sure the following are installed:

1. **Python 3.10.6**: Required to run the Flask application. Download it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3106/).
2. **Virtual Environment** (recommended): To keep dependencies isolated.
3. **Flask**: Flask is the Python web framework used to handle requests.

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/a1n13a1n13d4/Internet-Speed-Finder.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd Internet-Speed-Finder
   ```

3. **Create a Virtual Environment**

   This step is recommended to isolate project dependencies.

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv  # On Windows, use `python -m venv venv`
   ```

4. **Activate the Virtual Environment**

   - **On Windows:**

     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - **On MacOS/Linux:**

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. **Install Required Packages**

   Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies for the project:

   ```bash
   pip install flask speedtest-cli
   ```

6. **Run the Application**

   Start the Flask application by executing the following command in the terminal:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   After running this command, you can access the application by navigating to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your web browser.

## Usage

1. **Start the Test**: Click on "Start Test" to begin measuring download speed, upload speed, and ping.
2. **Retry the Test**: After the first results appear, use the "Retry" button to rerun the test.
3. **View Results**: The results will display download speed, upload speed, and ping once the test completes.

### Important Note

Ensure your application has a `/speedtest` endpoint or equivalent to simulate or fetch speed data. You may use mock data if real-time testing APIs aren’t available.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the web page.
- **CSS3**: For styling, including animations and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript**: Adds interactivity and handles front-end logic.
- **Flask**: A lightweight web framework to serve the application.

### Troubleshooting

- **Error: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'flask'`**: Ensure your virtual environment is activated and Flask is installed by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- **Static Files Not Loading**: Verify that the static file paths in HTML are correct and that `logo.png` is in the `static/images` directory.
- **Slow Test Results**: Network conditions can affect speed tests; try testing at different times for more accurate results.
